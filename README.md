OpenTA is an attempt to recreate the original Total Annihilation from
scratch. It's still early days and there's no gameplay, so don't get
too excited just yet.

Building
========
Building OpenTA is easy:
- clone this repository and it's submodules
- compile source/openta/ta_main.c using your favourite compiler
  
You may need to link to a few ubiquitous system libraries, but there are
no hard to build dependencies.



License
=======
The code in this repository is released under the MIT license, but you
need the original game's assets in order to actually run it which you'll
need to buy if you don't already have it. You can buy the game from GoG.
