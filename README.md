OpenTA is an attempt to recreate the original Total Annihilation from scratch. It's still early days and there's no gameplay, so don't
get too excited just yet.

#Building
Building OpenTA is easy:
- clone this repository
- clone dr_libs (https://github.com/mackron/dr_libs) into the same root directory
- compile ta_main.c using your favourite compiler
  
You may need to link to a few ubiquitous system libraries, but there are no hard to build dependencies.



#License
The code in this repository is in the public domain, but you need the original game's assets in order to actually run it which you'll
need to buy if you don't already have it. You can buy the game from GoG.
